***TODO***

-qbuilder.regex_filter needs to be made smarter. This is for fields where we want the user to be able to enter a
text search using regular expressions. Right now it supports entering items separated by commas or items in quotes,
but a search combining these things doesn't work as expected (in fact it completely breaks the query).
	As an alternative to fixing this up, could simply have a note explaining SPARQL's regex syntax and get users to
use that directly. This is somewhat less user friendly to people who aren't familiar with using regular expressions
than the current parsing, but would probably be simple enough given an explanation and should avoid any weird
behaviour.

-Write tests for all current functionality, fix any major problems this exposes. This task is on hold
pending the availability of a proper testing environment - query the actual live database is not going to
be terribly useful for testing purposes, and this limits what's possible here.

-Ability to do other things with selected items/speakers such as search by or export to Alveo.

***OPTIONAL/LOW PRIORITY***

-Ability to add items/speakers directly by their URIs. Low priority because it's not clear how useful
this would be. Best guess is "not very", but I can think of situations where it might be wanted and it shouldn't
be too hard to implement.

-Some redirects still don't have message, esp. those that point to the login page.

-On the itemresults page, prompts don't always display correctly. Also, some prompts are very long. 
Should probably limit the number of characters displayed.

-Add language usage as a searchable field for speakers. Not sure exactly how this needs to be implemented, on
hold for now.

-Cache values for drop down boxes in speaker search. The search page loads a little slowly, takes around
5 seconds.

-Get first language field displaying in search results. This is kind of messy because some values for this
field are URIs that need to be converted and some are literals. Might not bother. The search does work correctly.

-Make column headings look nicer in search results. Very low priority.

-CSV export of search results.
