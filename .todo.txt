***TODO***

-Would like to display a list of a user's existing item lists on the export page, so they can add to one without
needing to remember it's name.

-qbuilder.regex_filter needs to be made smarter. This is for fields where we want the user to be able to enter a
text search using regular expressions. Right now it supports entering items separated by commas or items in quotes,
but a search combining these things doesn't work as expected (in fact it completely breaks the query).
	As an alternative to fixing this up, could simply have a note explaining SPARQL's regex syntax and get users to
use that directly. This is somewhat less user friendly to people who aren't familiar with using regular expressions
than the current parsing, but would probably be simple enough given an explanation and should avoid any weird
behaviour.

-Write tests for all current functionality, fix any major problems this exposes.

-Add language usage as a searchable field for participants. Not sure exactly how this needs to be implemented, on
hold for now.

***OPTIONAL/LOW PRIORITY***

-On the itemresults page, prompts don't always display correctly. Something to do with the regex for pulling
the data we actually want out of the raw query results. Also, some prompts are very long. Should probably limit
the number of characters displayed.

-Cache values for drop down boxes in participant search. The search page loads a little slowly, takes around
5 seconds.

-Ability to remove participants from the selected list on the results page of a participant search, before
selecting items. Maybe also include a box to add a participant directly by URI?

-Get first language field displaying in search results. This is kind of messy because some values for this
field are URIs that need to be converted and some are literals. Might not bother. The search does work correctly.

-"Total matches" on itemresults page includes participants for whom no items were found in the Alveo database
as if they were a single search result, making it slightly inaccurate. Low priority to fix this bug.

-Make column headings look nicer in search results. Very low priority.

-CSV export of search results.
