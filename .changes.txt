-Started factoring query building out of main and into qbuilder.py. When this is finished, what I'm hoping is that we'll have a function that allows us to build an entire SPARQL query with a single call to some function in qbuilder. This would make qbuilder a pretty useful thing in its own right and would be a good step towards generalising the app to be able to query collections other than austalk. Although that's not a particularly high priority at the moment.

-Now using beaker to keep the most recent list of participants from search results in the session data. Had to rewrite a bunch of stuff to get this working. Also using this to store the count for the number of search results from a query now, which let me clear up something that was kind of nasty about alquery.htmlTable.

-Added itemresults.tpl and a button to get all the items for the selected participants to the results page. 
-Renamed "results" to "presults". 
-Renamed "search" to "psearch".
